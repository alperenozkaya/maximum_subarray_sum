# Maximum Subarray Sum

This project was completed as part of the Analysis of Algorithms course and entails implementing various algorithms to address the same problem: finding the maximum subarray sum in a given array. We were tasked to implement, analyze, and compare three distinct algorithms with different complexities: **O(n^2)**, **O(n log n)**, and **O(n)**.

The solutions for these complexities were approached using the brute-force, divide-and-conquer, and Kadane's algorithms, respectively. To accurately analyze these algorithms, we utilized multithreading to find the average values efficiently, avoiding excessive waiting times.

The results, comprising the maximum subarray sum and corresponding running times, were stored in lists. The output is printed on the console and also visualized using the Matplotlib library for better understanding and comparison.
